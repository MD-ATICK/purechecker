                    <AccordionTrigger>How does pure checker work?</AccordionTrigger>
                    <AccordionContent>
                        PureChecker streamlines email verification by conducting a thorough set of checks to ensure the accuracy and validity of email addresses. When you submit an email, PureChecker verifies its syntax for proper formatting, confirms the validity of the domain, and checks whether the email is associated with a disposable service. Additionally, it determines if the email exists on the server and evaluates its risk level. The system identifies whether the email is active or disabled, if itâ€™s a free service, and its associated role or purpose. With these detailed results, PureChecker provides actionable insights, helping you maintain clean and reliable email lists. Whether verifying single emails or processing bulk uploads, PureChecker ensures a seamless and efficient experience for all users.                  </AccordionContent>
